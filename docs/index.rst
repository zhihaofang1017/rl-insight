Welcome to RL-Insight's documentation!
========================

RL-Insight is a performance insight and observability toolkit for reinforcement learning (RL) systems.
It focuses on analyzing offline cluster logs first, and is evolving towards full-stack online monitoring
and visualization.

Code Linting and Formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use pre-commit to help improve code quality. To initialize pre-commit, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install

To resolve CI errors locally, you can also manually run pre-commit by:

.. code-block:: bash

   pre-commit run

Adding CI tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If possible, please add CI test(s) for your new feature:

1. Find the most relevant workflow yml file.
2. Add related path patterns to the ``paths`` section if not already included.
3. Minimize the workload of the test script(s) (see existing scripts for examples).
